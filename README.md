# SpringBoot-AngularJs

This project was created as task for internship. This was my first time using **Springboot** and **Angular**. This is simple crud task where you can **Add** and **Edit** elements.

To run this project:
1. Fork or download this project
2. Open console in derictory **$/PetsThing/demo**
3. Type in console **$ mvn spring-boot:run**. This will start backend
4. Open a new console and go to derictory **$/PetsThing/demo/angularclient** and type **ng serve --open**. This will start Angular and browser will open.
